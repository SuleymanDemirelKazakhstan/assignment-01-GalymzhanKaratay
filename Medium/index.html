                <td>The Porsche Taycan Turbo S I was given to test out looks 
                    pretty much exactly like the Mission E prototype unveiled 
                    at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. Same pearly white color, 
                    same tapered headlights with four diode blocks that cover 
                    large vertical air intakes. Same smooth muzzle without the 
                    grille that makes it look like a 911. Which is totally intentional, 
                    of course.The Taycan may be configured as a sedan, but it's sleek 
                    and streamlined like a coupe, with a receding roofline. The 
                    Taycan Turbo S also looks like a Panamera, with its curved 
                    fenders and a wide rear section that thin LED headlamps pass 
                    through in one sweeping stroke. However, it is 23.6 cm shorter 
                    and 5.5 cm lower on 2.8 cm wider tracks.</td>

                <td>The 2020 BMW X7 ranks in the top half of the luxury large SUV class. 
                    It combines strong engine performance and composed handling with a 
                    spacious and well-trimmed interior that has mostly user-friendly 
                    features. The 2020 BMW X7's #4 ranking is based on its score within 
                    the Luxury Large SUVs category. Currently the BMW X7 has a score of 
                    7.7 out of 10, which is based on our evaluation of 12 pieces of research 
                    and data elements using various sources. BMW launched the X7 as an all-new 
                    SUV for 2019. It was initially available in two trim levels: the 
                    335-horsepower xDrive40i and the 456-horsepower xDrive50i. Since these 
                    trims havenâ€™t seen any major changes for 2020, you may want to consider 
                    saving money with a similar 2019 model.</td>
